# Maze-generator
This project was inspired by a video of Daniel Shiffman from The Coding Train on YouTube. I tried implementing the recursive backtracker algorithm to generate mazes, but I had trouble with some of the phases and looked at some of Shiffman's code to resolve them.
This uses the p5.js library.
